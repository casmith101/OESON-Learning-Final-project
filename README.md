# OESON-Learning-Final-project

In this project, I conducted EDA on a Json file of queries and responses. I then created a sequential deep neural network model to predict the response from the query. I used TfidfVectorizer to learn the vocabulary and then visualized the model accuracy and chatbot word cloud.
